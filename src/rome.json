    "Name": "Decimus Appollonius",
    "About": "A senator whose family comes from a long line of distinguished patrician Romans, so long that you all have practically forgotten who you’re related to. Decimus has a good family life and loyal clients. His two sons are his pride and joy. But he doesn’t have a lot of money, having lost it in bad business dealings over the years. He is hopeful that his new antiquities business will be successful, and hopes his new antiquities expert Erasmus (and your Greek language tutor Hami) can help him locate some valuable treasures for sale. Decimus is considered a low-ranking senator and an undynamic figure in Roman society",
